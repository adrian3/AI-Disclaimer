# AI-Disclaimer Assets

This repo is a collection of assets that help users self-identify whether or not AI was used in the creation of their art. 

Here's why that is important...

It will soon be impossible to distinguish AI from human-generated art. 

There will never be a law requiring the disclosure of AI assistance in the media we consume. If you expect commercial productions to voluntarily identify their use of AI you will be disappointed. It’s not going to happen. Big productions will always cut corners, and AI is the most tantalizing cost-saving measure any industry has ever been tempted by. It’s not going away, and we will never be able to spot the fakes. 

Or could we?

Here’s an alternative idea…
What if instead of relying on the AI producers to identify their sins, we as the humans who shun AI, self-identify our work as AI-free?

I propose that creatives voluntarily add a “Statement of Creative Transparency” to the work they are making. 

If every non-AI artist identifies their own work as a purely human creation, it will become increasingly obvious when the disclaimer is missing. This should raise the question in your mind about how authentic the content you are consuming is. It also helps those of us who reject AI art to identify each other and support like-minded creators.

If you would like to use my disclaimer, I’ve released the logo and animation I am using under a free  creative-commons license. Use it as is or modify to suit your needs. 

And spread the word. 

The real power of this idea is when it becomes so widely used, that a missing disclaimer is a red flag that the work you are viewing probably isn’t created entirely by a human and that whoever created is trying to hide the fact.
